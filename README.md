CloudFoundry-EnvironmentDemo
============================

This is a small, simple, Java Spring Boot application suitable for use as a demo application when deploying on cloud foundry.  It is used as a publicly available sample application for the Pivotal CF Introduction and Cloud Foundry for Developers courses.

To be easily "forkable" in Git, this needs to be a top-level project in the repository.
